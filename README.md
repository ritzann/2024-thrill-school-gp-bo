# Teaching material for the course "AI for Optimization and Control" at the 2024 THRILL Summer School, HyÃ¨res, France

Event details: https://indico.gsi.de/event/19869/

This is Part II of the Machine Learning course: https://github.com/elcorto/2024-thrill-school-machine-learning.git. 

[8 October 2024] This material is still being updated as of this date. For the final version for the summer school, please download or re-download on 10 October 2024 (Thursday) at 12 nn onwards. However, you can follow the installation instructions for now.

## Installation instructions for local execution

=====================================================

[Skip if you've done the Python installation already.]

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Please install the software components as described below **before** the
> course and try to make sure that things work. If you run into problems, we
> will of course help you fix them on day 1 of course, but the goal is that
> most learners have their a software setup ready to go.


* If you don't have a local Python installation, try
  [miniconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda) or install Python with
  [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv)
  by
  * first [installing `uv`
    itself](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)
  * [use `uv python install`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/install-python/)

  Both `miniconda` and `uv` work on MacOS, Linux and Windows.

======================================================

* create a `venv`: [If you want to use your existing environment from Part 1.]
  * if you installed Python via `uv`

    ```sh
    uv venv thrill24
    source thrill24/bin/activate
    ```

  * else

    ```sh
    python -m venv thrill24
    source thrill24/bin/activate
    ```

* OR create a new `venv`: [If you want to create a separate enviroment.]
  * if you installed Python via `uv`

    ```sh
    uv venv thrill24-bo
    source thrill24-bo/bin/activate
    ```

  * else

    ```sh
    python -m venv thrill24-bo
    source thrill24-bo/bin/activate
    ```

* Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/ritzann/2024-thrill-school-gp-bo.git`
* Change into the repo root folder: `cd 2024-thrill-school-gb-bo`
* [!For the new environment, you can skip `torch` installation unless you want to use [`BoTorch`](https://botorch.org/) in the future.]
* (optional) Install CPU-only [`torch`](https://pytorch.org/) (all code
  examples use small models and a toy dataset, so running on a laptop without a
  GPU is fine)

  ```sh
  uv pip install --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu torch
  ```

  or

  ```sh
  python -m pip install --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu torch
  ```

* install all other requirements via 

  ```sh
  uv pip install -r ./requirements.txt
  ```

  or

  ```sh
  python -m pip install -r ./requirements.txt
  ```


## NOTES

This repo has a small utility prepared which can check if you software
environment is ready. Either run

```sh
python notebooks/00_intro2ml_envcheck.py
```

or open the paired notebook `notebooks/00_intro2ml_envcheck.ipynb` with
Jupyter, read the instructions and execute all cells.
